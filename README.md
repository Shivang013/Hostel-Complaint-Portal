# Hostel Complaint Portal

A full-stack MERN application for managing hostel maintenance complaints with role-based access control. Students file complaints; wardens and admins triage, assign, and resolve them through a tracked status lifecycle.

## Features

- **JWT authentication with role-based access control** — three roles (student, warden, admin), each with different permissions enforced at the route level
- **Complaint lifecycle management** — `pending → in_progress → resolved → closed`, with a full status-change history per complaint
- **Image attachments** — students can attach a photo to a complaint (Multer, local disk storage)
- **Admin/warden dashboard** — filter complaints by status/category/priority, with aggregated counts (MongoDB aggregation pipeline)
- **Complaint assignment** — admins can assign complaints to specific wardens
- **Status-change notifications** — students are notified by email when their complaint's status changes (Nodemailer; gracefully no-ops if SMTP isn't configured)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Axios, Context API for auth state
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt
- **File uploads:** Multer
- **Email:** Nodemailer

## Getting Started

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET
npm run seed            # creates admin@hostel.com / admin123 and warden@hostel.com / warden123
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`. Register a new account to test the student flow, or log in with the seeded admin/warden accounts to test the staff flow.

## Resume Bullet Points (suggested)

- Built a full-stack MERN application implementing **role-based access control** across three user types, enforced via custom Express middleware rather than simple authenticated/unauthenticated checks
- Designed a **status-lifecycle state machine** for complaint tracking with a full audit trail of status changes
- Implemented **MongoDB aggregation pipelines** to power a real-time admin dashboard with filterable, categorized complaint statistics
- Integrated file uploads (Multer) and event-driven email notifications (Nodemailer) without external paid services
